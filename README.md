# Solana Development Utilities

A collection of utilities and macros to enhance Solana program development, focusing on compute unit logging and instruction discriminant generation.

## Features

- Generate unique instruction discriminants for Anchor programs
- Log compute units for functions and code blocks
- Utility functions for Solana-specific operations

## Installation

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
sol_dev_utils = "0.1.2"
sol_dev_macros = "0.1.2"
sol_dev_proc_macros = "0.1.2"
```

For parsing the logs, the cli can be installed using:
```bash
cargo install sol-dev-cli
```



## Usage

### Instruction Discriminants
Handles the global namespace automatically if no namespace is provided.

```rust
use sol_dev_proc_macros::anchor_discriminant;

match discriminant {
    anchor_discriminant![initialize] => initialize(),
    // This is equivalent to:
    // anchor_discriminant![global:initialize] => initialize(),
    anchor_discriminant![process] => process(),
    anchor_discriminant![custom:finalize] => finalize(),
    _ => return Err(ProgramError::InvalidInstructionData.into()),
}
```

### Compute Unit Logging
- Function-level logging
```rust
use sol_dev_proc_macros::compute_fn;

#[compute_fn]
fn some_fn() {
    // Function body
}
```
- Code block logging
```rust
use sol_dev_macros::compute_fn;

compute_fn!("My Operation" => {
    // Your code here
    some_fn();
});
```

### Log Parsing

The *CLI* can be used to parse the logs generated by the compute unit logging macros. 
The logs can be parsed from a file or a directory containing multiple log files.
```bash
sol-dev-cli parse dir <path-to-dir>
```
```bash
sol-dev-cli parse file <path-to-file>
```

Output will be in the form of a JSON object containing the logs.
